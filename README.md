REST endpoints
I decide to go with REST endpoints because:
1. REST is easier to work with(Simplicity)
2. REST has a well established standards
3. It's what im familiar more

Stack used, Typescript, Next.js & Tailwindcss
    I chose TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS because I'm comfortable with ReactJS,
    and I wanted to explore new tools to boost my productivity and resourcefullness. 
    Next.js surprised me with how smoothly it handles both frontend and backend tasks,
    It booseted my productivity by far plus since it your main stack i chose to get a test of how the stack handles 
    projects, I'll admit in liking the stack more
    Opting for Tailwind CSS was a no-brainer; its simplicity in crafting responsive designs, 
    especially in tandem with Next.js, simplified the styling process.
    This stack not only showcases my skills in both frontend and backend but also reflects my commitment to creating sleek and efficient web applications.
