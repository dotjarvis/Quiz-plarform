## REST endpoints

I decide to go with REST endpoints because:

- REST is easier to work with(Simplicity)
- REST has a well established standards
- It's what I am familiar with more

## Stack used: Typescript, Next.js & Tailwindcss

- Reasons

  1. I'm comfortable with ReactJS already and desire to explore productivity-boosting tools
  2. It's the main stack used in the your projects plus you strongly recommended it
  3. Need to be resourceful, Next.js surprised me with how smoothly it handles both frontend and backend tasks significantly enhancing productivity.
  4. Tailwind CSS; its simplicity in crafting responsive designs, especially in tandem with Next.js

## Design & Implementation Decisions

Once there was no design, so I opted for a simple layout design to display data.

Placing the search bar as part of the navigation bar for the website seemed logical, so I decided it would be positioned at the top of the homepage.

I chose to make the location name bigger and bolder as it serves as the introduction to the location section, where residents' names, pictures, and status are displayed.

Selecting a white background with black text ensured easy visibility for users.

For styling the residents' details, I decided to use a grid layout because it's easy to adjust for responsiveness and much simpler to work with.

On the characters page, I maintained the layout with a picture card at the top, followed by text large enough to be easily viewed by users.
